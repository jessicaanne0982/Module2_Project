To Do List Application

Description:

Using Python, the To Do List Application allows a user to create and modify their own To Do List.
Users are able to add tasks to the list, view their list, mark tasks 'completed', delete tasks, 
and finally, quit the application. 

How to Run:

The program can easily be run in a computer's Terminal window.

Usage:

When the user initially runs the program, they are greeted with a Welcome message and a menu of options to choose from.  If they enter option 1, they are prompted to enter the task they'd like to add to the list.  From there, they are given the opportunity to continue adding tasks until they have no more to add. When finished, they are given the option to enter another number on the menu.  Entering number 2 allows the user to see the items on the list, including which tasks are complete and which have yet to be completed. Choosing the third menu option prompts the user to enter which task they've completed and asks if they have more to mark completed.  Once no more tasks need to be marked completed, the user is prompted to choose another option from the menu items.  The fourth option gives the user the ability to delete tasks from the list.  Finally, option nubmer 5 thanks the user for using the To Do List Application and quits the program.
